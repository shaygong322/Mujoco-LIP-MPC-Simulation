# LIP-MPC
A multi-step preview plan based on the discrete-time step-to-step LIP model using a Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulation:
1. MPC framework enables the incorporation of essential kinematic and dynamic constraints
2. Integrating discrete-time Control Barrier Functions (D-CBFs) ensuring the generation of safe (i.e., collision-free) pathways in clustered environments
